# UndeadHorses
A restored version of my UndeadHorses plugin.

This was a plugin I made years ago to help myself learn Java. I was only 14! Sadly I don't think it will work with any modern version of the game.

The website is here: https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/undead-horses

Somebody else continued the plugin after I finished working on it, it was fufilling to see that people enjoyed it!
